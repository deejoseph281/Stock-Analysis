# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the performance of 12 green stocks using their market starting prices, market closing prices, and volumes traded in 2017 and 2018. In order to run this analysis, without manually reviewing each stock, we created a VBA code to analyze the 12 stocks, and the code allows the user to run the analysis on future stocks and years as well.

## Results
The results of this analysis was a code that can analyze the daily volume and return of each stock for the year, as well as the individual comparison of a single stock's daily volume and return. From the analysis, we can conclude that the stock with the strongest performance was ENPH and RUN and the other green stocks did not create positive returns in 2018.
